Hello there, I'm Ezgi, </br>
an architecture graduate with experience in designing. My studies focus on spatial design and Machine Learning, and I'm also interested in scripting for software such as Revit and Rhino to extend design possibilities and make workflows more efficient.

👨‍💻 **Professional Skills:** 
- **BackEnd:** Java, Python, C++
- **FrontEnd:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **DevOps:** Linux, Vagrant, Shell scripting, Vim, Git, Docker

⭐️ **Data Structures and Algorithms:**  
My Leetcode account: [TastanEzgi](https://leetcode.com/TastanEzgi/)

🌱 **Challenges I’m Currently Pursuing:**  
- Network
- Advanced Algorithms
- Learning GoLang! (Wait for me OpenSource projects!!)

👯 **I’m looking to collaborate on:**  
Machine Learning and DevOps projects.

💼 **Projects I'm currently working on:**  
- Writing a 3D program expected to be used in the architectural field, leveraging certain algorithms.
- Developing a groundbreaking 3D architectural design application. My GitHub repository encapsulates a project driven by a fusion of innovative algorithms and user-centric design. Through cutting-edge data structures and algorithms, this endeavor aims to revolutionize the architectural field by providing architects and students with a sophisticated tool for optimal design outcomes. The project focuses on seamlessly integrating algorithmic approaches into the architectural workflow, ensuring that the resultant 3D models are visually captivating and functionally optimized.
